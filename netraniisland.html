        Netrani (historically known as Bajrangi Island, Pigeon Island and also Heart Shaped Island)[1] is a small island of India located in the Arabian Sea. It is off the coast of Karnataka situated approximately 10 nautical miles (19 km) from the temple town of Murudeshwara in Bhatkal Taluka. The island can be seen from the mainland over 15 km (9.3 miles) away. Views above give this island the appearance of being heart-shaped. Its animal inhabitants include wild goats and pigeons. It has scuba diving facilities and is easily accessible from Bhatkal, Mangalore, Goa, Mumbai or Bangalore. There are dive shops at Murdeshwara and Goa which regularly organize trips to the island.[2] It is known locally as Nitra Gudo. The famous Hindu temple Jai Bajrangbali Temple is located here.
