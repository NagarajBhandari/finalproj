        Unchalli Falls, also known as Lushington Falls, is a waterfall created by a 116-metre (381 ft) drop in the Aghanashini river. The fall is located near Sirsi in Uttara Kannada District of Karnataka, India. The falls are named for J. D. Lushington, a District Collector for the British Government, who discovered the falls in 1845. Heggarne, a hamlet in Uttara Kannada district, is 33 km from Sirsi. The falls are reached by a 5-kilometre (3.1 mi) trek from Heggarne through thick forest. Here the river makes a cavalcade of water falls and eventually leaps into a steep valley to form a spectacular, picturesque waterfall. The falls are sometimes called Keppa Joga because of the deafening sound they make.
