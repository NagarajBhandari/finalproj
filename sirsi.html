        Sirsi Marikamba Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Marikamba Devi a form of the goddess Durga, located in Sirsi, Karnataka, It is also known as Marigudi, It was built in 1688, Sirsi Shri Marikamba Devi is "elder sister" of all Marikamba Devi's in Karnataka.<br>
        The main priest at the temple belongs to the carpenter, or Vishvakarma, caste.[1][3] Kanakadasa, a famous saint poet of the Bhakti movement, had visited the temple and advised the people to stop animal sacrifice of the he-buffalo.[4] When Mahatma Gandhi visited Sirsi in 1934, during his campaign to abolish untouchability of Dalits, he refused to visit the temple, as animal sacrifice was a prevalent ancient practice at the temple; the sacrifice was in the form of offering of he-buffalo as a sacrifice to appease the goddess.[1] A he-buffalo was specially bred for offering as a sacrifice to the deity during the annual Rathayatra. Following the protest by Gandhi, there was a social movement in the town not only to abolish animal sacrifice but also to allow Dalits entry into the temple. This movement was spearheaded by Keshwain, chief trustee of the temple, in association with Vitthal Rao Hodike, a teacher and dedicated Gandhian of the town. Both objectives of the movement were fulfilled.
