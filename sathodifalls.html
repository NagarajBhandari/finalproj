        Sathoddi Falls is a beautiful hidden waterfall in the Western Ghats, near Yellapur in Uttara Kannada District of Karnataka, India. Waterfall is formed by number of unnamed streams and falls from the height of 50ft. The stream then flows into the backwaters of the Kodasalli Dam, into the Kali River. Road to the waterfall is not in good conditions, but not too dangerus too. but 5km road near the falls is good. There is an concrete walk path of around 1km from the parking area to reach the foot of the waterfall. View of the waterfall is mesmerizing. Best time to visit is during December to March when waterfowl is moderate and one can take a dip in the clean and crystal water. It's also heaven for nature lovers during the monsoon. On the way there is an hanging bridge called Shivapura hanging bridge, 5km before the falls, which is constructed on the backwaters of the Kodasalli dam across the hills, which gives a mesmerizing views of the backwater and surrounding hills. Sathodi Falls is located at approx 35km from Yellapur, 90km from Hubli, 467km from Bengaluru, 190km from Goa, 483km from Pune.
